    caption: John Simpson is the inventor of the over-the-wire balloon catheter, which he is pictured here holding. Dr. Simpson created this catheter after visiting Andreas Gruentzig and ordering a box of standard balloon catheters. When the box arrived at his Menlo Park home, pieces were missing. Dr. Simpson jerry-rigged a new device that he named the over-the-wire balloon catheter. He has founded numerous companies including Advanced Cardiovascular Instruments and Devices for Vascular Intervention.

      description: Inventor of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
      url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Imran
    caption: Mir Imran emigrated to the United States from India to attend Rutgers University, where he obtained degrees in electrical engineering and biomedical engineering. While a student, he took a summer job that led to developing a device for children with cerebral palsy that enabled them to speak using the muscles in their neck. He followed this experience with work at Intec Systems that led to the invention of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). As an entrepreneur, he participated in the founding of 23 companies out of his incubator, InCube.
