title: Adobe and Apple
summary: Douglas Menuez has documented progress in Silicon Valley during a period stretching from the early 1980s through the Internet boom.  With an eye for capturing illustrative moments in the histories of companies such as Adobe, Apple, NeXT, Intel, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and several startups, he has worked behind the scenes in a range of settings from boardrooms to design meetings to launch events.

    note: Apple and Adobe are both among the Valley’s most visible success stories in the area of desktop computing. The histories of these two companies were closely linked during the 1980s, beginning with Steve Jobs attempt to acquire Adobe in the early 1980s, which resulted in his acquisition of a significant portion of the stock issued by the company. After Jobs left Apple, the launch of Adobe Illustrator for the Apple Macintosh in early 1987, followed in 1990 by the release of Adobe Photoshop, also for the Macintosh, proved beneficial for both companies.

    note: John Warnock and Chuck Geschke co-founded Adobe in 1982 after leaving Xerox PARC to develop PostScript, a page description language that could be applied to desktop printing and publication. Adobe, which like other Silicon Valley started in a garage (Warnock’s), derives its name from the creek behind Warnock’s home in Los Altos, California

    note: PostScript enabled computers to print a file exactly as it appeared on screen on a piece of paper, a feat that revolutionized desktop publishing. It featured specifications and algorithms for producing fonts that corresponded accurately to letter-form type in many languages and character sets.

    note: Photoshop’s features enabled photo editors to easily edit images. It remains the industry standard for photo editing. Like Apple, Adobe occasionally involved artists and other celebrities in the design process, such as David Hockney (seated second from left in this image).

    note: Before Photoshop was launched as a product, it was difficult to predict how large the market would be for it. Events such as the Adobe Photoshop Invitational in 1990 created energy around the product and may have increased its popularity by connecting Adobe’s creative team with potential users such as artists and photographers.

    note: Adobe released its Portable Document Format (PDF) in 1992, followed one year later by Adobe Acrobat, software based on the format that gave its users the ability to interact with Portable Digital Files, also commonly known as PDFs. This proprietary document format became the industry standard for digital documents, such that in 2008 the International Organization for Standardization released an open PDF standard.

    note: Sculley brought his marketing experience from previous positions at Pepsi to Apple. One of the priorities of Apple’s advertising under Sculley was to market lower-cost machines to families, with the goal of building Apple’s consumer base among educators, artists and other professionals more interested in higher-end personal computers.

    note: >
      The Newton was a device conceived of by Michael Tchao in 1991 and released in August of 1993, shortly before Sculley would leave Apple. While not commercially successful, the Newton pointed the way forward to a new kind of computing device: the personal digital assistant, or PDA.

    note: The launch of the Newton in 1993 at the Boston Symphony Hall continued the Apple tradition of splashy product introductions established by Jobs and Sculley with the Macintosh in 1984. Doug Menuez’ images capture the last-minute preparations and stress of event marketing."
