summary: The Silicon Genesis collection gathers together oral histories and interviews with the people who conceived, built and worked in the semiconductor industry centered in Silicon Valley since the 1950s.This project took shape in 1995 through the inspiration of Rob Walker (1935-2016), a Silicon Valley native and Silicon Valley educated electrical engineer, who was involved with semiconductors since the 1960s at Fairchild, Intel and as a founder of LSI Logic. Walker, followed  by industry veteran Rob Blair, have conducted these interviews, supplemented by a series produced by Craig Addision for SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) that were donated to the Silicon Valley Archives.
