summary: Many communities have contributed to Silicon Valley, and in many ways. Unfortunately, their lives and work are not always represented in the archival collections that have been amassed to date. Starting in 2019, following a transformative gift from the Harold C. and Marilyn A. Holbach Foundation, the Silicon Valley Archive worked with collaborators both inside and outside the library to address the lack and under-representation of African Americans in Silicon Valley.
