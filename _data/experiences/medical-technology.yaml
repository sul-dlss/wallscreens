summary: The Medicine and Innovation collection of oral history interviews presents the history of medical device technology, with a focus on inventors, entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley. While medical technology is perhaps not as frequently associated with this region as biotechnology, it is nevertheless an area in which Stanford University and companies located in the Valley have played a leading role. In collaboration with the Stanford Byers Center for Biodesign, the Silicon Valley Archives is producing these interviews to provide the perspectives and stories of those who built an industry that today is represented by hundreds of companies in Northern California.
