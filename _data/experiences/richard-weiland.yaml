subtitle: Images from the Richard William Weiland Papers
summary: Ric Weiland earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at Stanford in 1976. His first job after Stanford was with his former high school classmates Bill Gates and Paul Allen at Microsoft, where he managed the completion of the COBOL compiler and helped develop Microsoft’s BASIC interpreter. He left the company at the age of 35 in 1988 to pursue full-time philanthropy, where his interests included education; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights; health and human services; and the environment.  The Weiland papers in the Stanford Libraries document his work at Microsoft, as an activist for the LGBTQ movement (particularly in the Seattle area), and his extensive philanthropy, as well as his personal life.

After leaving Microsoft in 1988, he became a philanthropist and activist for the LGBTQ movement, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.

    note: After his period away at the Harvard Business School, he rejoined Microsoft and led the Microsoft Works project. Works was launched as a commercial product for MS-DOS in 1987. The “apps development” group seen here in this photograph Weiland likely took in 1986 was probably the team that developed the various office productivity applications bundled together as Works.

    note: At the very end of 1985, Weiland wrote a seven-page summary of his life and work during the last five months of that year. His reflections range from beginning work on the software that would become Microsoft Works, which he calls “Windows Works” here, to revealing that he spent an October afternoon in the Stanford Library and “wrote up his expectations.”  Unfortunately, “SF did not live up to them.”

In his will, he distributed an additional $68 million to a group of groups focused on LGBT activism. All told, his charitable and philanthropic donations totaled roughly $170 million over the course of his life.
