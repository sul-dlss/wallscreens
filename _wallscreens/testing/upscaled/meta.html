<h3>Video</h3>
<p>
  These are examples of video &mdash; intended for the <strong>physical</strong> wallscreen &mdash; that Michael digitized so we can figure out the best way to fit source video that could be in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 aspect ratio in the content area of the wallscreen.

  These were encoded at <samp>H264@~25 mbps/320 kbps AAC audio, mp4.</samp>
