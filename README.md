curated experiences for touch-screen installations on the stanford campus.

## local development
wallscreens uses the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, which [requires ruby](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/#prerequisites).

after cloning the repository, install dependencies:
```sh
$ bundle install
```
then, you can start a local development server:
```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve  # or with --livereload
```
the site should be visible at http://localhost:4000.

to build the site for production:
```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
this will generate HTML in a directory called `_site/`.

### Testing, Linting, CI
The JavaScript tests rely on modules installed via yarn. To install these dependencies run the following before running the test suite:
```
$ yarn install
```
There is a rake task (in `Rakefile`) to run the entire testing/linting suite:
```
$ bundle exec rake ci
```
You will also find tasks in `Rakefile` to run each test suite/linter individually.

#### HTML linting
We use [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) to lint and validate the HTML generated by `$ bundle exec jekyll build`. There is Rake task defined in `Rakefile` that first builds and then runs html-proofer on the result:
```
$ bundle exec rake html_proofer
```

#### Ruby linting
We use [rubocop](https://rubocop.org/) to lint Ruby code in the project. There is a Rake task included in `Rakefile` to run rubocop on the project:
```
$ bundle exec rake rubocop
```

#### Ruby testing
We use [rspec](https://rspec.info/) to test Ruby code in the project. There is a Rake task included in `Rakefile` to run the specs defined in `/spec/*`:
```
$ bundle exec rake rspec
```

#### JavaScript testing
We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test Stimulus.js code in the project. There is a Rake task included in `Rakefile` to run the specs defined in `/spec/javascript`:
```
$ bundle exec rake jest
```

### wallscreen specifications
- Pixels: 3840 x 2160
- Display Area: 56.2" x 31.6" (1428.5mm x 803.5mm)
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9

### browser device emulation
For local development it may be useful to emulate the dimensions of the wallscreens in your browser. Chrome and FireFox provide tools and documentation for developing sites for various size screens.

#### Chrome
- [Device Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/)
- [Adding Custom Devices](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/#custom)

#### FireFox
- [Responsive Design Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode)
- [Adding Custom Devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode#device_selection)

## wallscreen content
each wallscreen can host several experiences, and experiences can be shared across multiple wallscreens. an experience is a set of curated content, which can take the form of:
- a slideshow of many images with captions
- a guided tour that zooms in on locations in a single high-resolution image
- a video with multiple themed sections, each containing several clips

the content used in the wallscreens and experiences is stored as YAML files in the `_data/` directory. text content and media links supplied by curators are defined for each experience.

the layout of experience pages is defined by the HTML templates in the `_includes/` directory. these templates have access to the "global" data in the `_data/` folder via `site.wallscreens`.

### thumbnails
thumbnails are displayed in the card/slide area of guided tour and oral history experiences. these images should be included in the code repository for the project and meet the following naming conventions and specifications:

- thumbnail location: `images/wallscreens/{WALLSCREEN NAME}/{EXPERIENCE_NAME}/{SLIDE_KEY OR CLIP_KEY}.png`
- square aspect ratio, 200x200

### local media
media referenced in wallscreens can be checked-in to the git repository if rights statements permit it. otherwise, files should be downloaded and stored in the `local-media/` directory so that they can be referenced during the jekyll build process.

when adding media to an experience, you can use the custom `file_or_link` liquid tag to insert a file from `local-media/`, falling back to a supplied URL if the file isn't present locally:
```html
<img src="{% file_or_link {{local_file}} {{image_url}} %}">
```
note the lack of whitespace around interpolated values (`{{local_file}}`); this is necessary for the tag to parse correctly. when the path pointed to by `local_file` can't be found or wasn't supplied, jekyll will issue a warning when building and use the value of `image_url` instead.

## interactivity
wallscreens are designed to rotate through content continuously, in order to prevent screen burn-in and showcase the available experiences.

### autoplay
the oral history experience plays through its entire video if left alone; the guided tour and slideshow experiences will begin automatically cycling through content after an interval elapses where the user has not touched the wallscreen.

for testing and local development, this value can be edited (in, for example, `js/controllers/slideshow.js`):
```js
  static autoplayTimeout = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes before entering autoplay mode
```
after autoplay takes effect, the experience will spend some time on each slide before moving to the next. this value can also be edited:
```js
  static autoplayIntervalTime = 1 * 60 * 1000; // 1 minute per slide in autoplay mode
```
### attract mode
if an experience remains unattended for `autoplayTimeout` after it has completed, it will eventually return to its initial state. once it remains in this state for the duration of another `autoplayTimeout`, it will enter ["attract mode"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attract_mode), which cycles between a preview of each experience on the wallscreen.

this behavior is incorporated into the `autoplay()` method of each experience controller.
